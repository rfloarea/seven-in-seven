# Io

## Notes

- Io is a prototype language (like JS). Every object is a clone of another, called a _prototype_.
  - In a prototype language, every object is a clone of another object rather than a class.
- At a high level, "Io syntax simple chains messages together, with each message returning an object and each message taking optional parameters in parenthesis." p.46
  - "Everything is a message that returns another receiver." p.46
