# Seven-in-Seven

This is a repo dedicated to my notes and stumblings through the book, "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Brice A. Tate, 2010.

## From the Foreward

"Learning to program is like learning to swim", Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang.

Joe goes on to state the the quickest way to mastering a skill is through mimicry. I don't disagree. So long as find your own way comes at the right moment and in the right ways (for the learner).

I particularly like this passage, "By learning several different programming languages, you will be able to see which language is best suited to the kinds of problems that interest you most...Ultimately, programming is about understanding, and understanding is about ideas. So exposure to new ideas is essential to a deeper understanding of what programming is all about."

I want to understand what programming is all about. Not just understand, but _feel_ it.

## From the Introduction

Bruce outlines several questions that I will find the answers to as I progress through this book:

- What is the typing model?
  - Strong, weak, static, dynamic?
  - I'm told the typing model with "shape the way you attack a problem and control the way the language works.
- What is the programming model?
  - Object-oriented, functional, procedural, hybrid?
  - I'm told learning different programming paradigms is "one of the most important concepts in this book".
- How will you interact with it?
  - Compiled, interpreted? Through a virtual machine?
- What are the decision constructs and core data structures?
  - `if` and `while`, pattern matching, unification. What role do collections play? Wtf are collections?
- What are the core features that make the language unique?
  - Advanced concurrent features? High-level constructs like macros and message interpretation.

Much further along in the intro, Bruce hands us a warning and some guidance all wrapped up into one like a good teacher. I'll quote it here in full because I think it's worth coming back to.

> If you simply read this book, you'll experience the flavor of the syntax and no more. If you look online for the answers before trying to code the exercises yourself, you'll fail. You will want to try the exercises first, fully recognize that you;ll fail at a few of them. Learning syntax is always easier than learning to reason.

Beyond that, his final motivational stance is this: have fun. Which I find both truthful and quaint.
