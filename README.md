# Seven-in-Seven

This is a repo dedicated to my notes and stumblings through the book, "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Brice A. Tate, 2010.

## From the Foreward

"Learning to program is like learning to swim", Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang.

Joe goes on to state the the quickest way to mastering a skill is through mimicry. I don't disagree. So long as find your own way comes at the right moment and in the right ways (for the learner).

I particularly like this passage, "By learning several different programming languages, you will be able to see which language is best suited to the kinds of problems that interest you most...Ultimately, programming is about understanding, and understanding is about ideas. So exposure to new ideas is essential to a deeper understanding of what programming is all about."

I want to understand what programming is all about. Not just understand, but _feel_ it.

## From the Introduction

Bruce outlines several questions that I will find out about as I progress through this book. Let's call them the Five Core Questions

### The Five Core Questions

1. What is the typing model?

- Strong, weak, static, dynamic?
- I'm told the typing model with "shape the way you attack a problem and control the way the language works.

2. What is the programming model?

- Object-oriented, functional, procedural, hybrid?
- I'm told learning different programming paradigms is "one of the most important concepts in this book".

3. How will you interact with it?

- Compiled, interpreted? Through a virtual machine?

4. What are the decision constructs and core data structures?

- `if` and `while`, pattern matching, unification. What role do collections play? Wtf are collections?

5. What are the core features that make the language unique?

- Advanced concurrent features? High-level constructs like macros and message interpretation.

Much further along in the intro, Bruce hands us a warning and some guidance all wrapped up into one like a good teacher. I'll quote it here in full because I think it's worth coming back to.

> If you simply read this book, you'll experience the flavor of the syntax and no more. If you look online for the answers before trying to code the exercises yourself, you'll fail. You will want to try the exercises first, fully recognize that you;ll fail at a few of them. Learning syntax is always easier than learning to reason.

Beyond that, his final motivational stance is this: have fun. Which I find both truthful and quaint.

## How things are going

I'm working my way through Ruby. Love the language so far. I'm just starting to decode how this book works. I want to make sure that I'm always taking the time to consider _why_ Bruce is showing me certain aspects of the language. Because more than anything, my learning goal for this book is not to learn the languages (although getting an intro to several languages is motivating), it's to learn how to learn programming languages. Put another way, my task isn't to learn seven languages. My goal is to learn how I learn programming languaegs best, to develop my personal method for learning programming languages.

I expect that this is a long term goal. I expect that this book is merely a spark on that journey. But it feels important to me.

Pausing Ruby and moving on to Io because ADHD. I need something new.

Also, I'm very interested in learning about Io because Bruce says that it helped him learn JavaScript better. And since JS is the only language that anyone actually needs to know, it seems prudent to move on to this chapter. (heavy sarcasm)

I feel that I want to make a note to myself about my absence from this book/course/study thing.

I took a lot of time to explore what I'm really looking for from the Five Core Questions. I needed to have a better idea of what type systems actually are before I can benefit from understanding a language's type model. I also explored programming models: OOP, functional, etc. I feel that I have a better theoretical grasp and hope that that helps me understand these languages. 3, 4, 5 aren't as much of a mystery to me and they seem to be things that will be revealed as I progress from language to language. I'm not too worries about them.

I was also battling some personal demons. (Still am?) So that tends to take up quite a bit of attention/energy. Learning how to learn programming languages is not the most urgent thing in my life.
